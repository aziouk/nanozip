# A lightweight compression/decompression utility written in C for Zlib

Although the spontaneous reasoning of this excercise was to do some testing
with github/gitlab automation and the gh api and gcm I decided that
it would be fun to write a utility using binary tuples or huffman encryption
in the end though I settled writing it using zlib, since it is so widely available.

The project isn't really a commercial software but was an interesting excercise, some fun. 

In the future I will make nanozip so that it not depend on any external compression library
and to support multi level binary recursive tuple compression.
